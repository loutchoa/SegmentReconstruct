# This repos implements series of nonsmooth optimisation arount Algebraic Reconstruction Techniques and Segmentations.
- ART techniques in Pure Python for tomographic reconstruction, with global or local L<sup>1</sup>-regularisation
- Segmentation techniques as TV-regularized k-means and multiclass Hidden Markov Measure Fields models (Marroquín et al. 2002) which require projections onto probability simplices.
- Joint reconstruction and Segmentation Techniques based on the above.
